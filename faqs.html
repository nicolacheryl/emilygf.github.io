        <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
        <p class="lead">We've made a list of some of the most common enquiries about the scheme. See if your question is answered.
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>What gift cards are available?</h2>
        <h4>Tesco supply single use gift cards, in &pound;100, &pound;50 and &pound;20 denominations.<br>John Lewis also supply single use gift cards, in any denomination ending in &pound;...0 or &pound;...5, up to a maximum of &pound;2,500.<br>Sainsbury's supply reusable gift cards, which are topped up remotely each month with any amount up to &pound;2,000.</h4><br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Is there an expiry date on the cards?</h2>
        <h4>The Tesco cards are valid for five years from the date of last use.<br>The John Lewis cards are valid for two years from the date of last use.<br>The Sainsbury's cards have a rolling two year expiry date. <br>In all cases, simply checking the balance on the card will renew the start date of that period.</h4><br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>How often are the gift cards available?</h2>
        <h4>We place an order every month. The timetable for orders can be found in the <em>key dates</em> tab. We sell Tesco and John Lewis cards from September to July. The Sainsbury's cards can be topped up every month, including August.</h4><br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Do I still get Clubcard or Nectar points?</h2>
        <h4>Yes - simply show or scan your Clubcard or Nectar card at the checkout as normal before paying with your gift card and you will still get all your points.<br>If you have a Tesco credit card, but choose to pay with a gift card, you will not get the extra Clubcard points. However, the low number of extra points is relatively insignificant compared to the extra 5% discount the school receives, so please bear this in mind.<br>Likewise, a John Lewis credit card will give you 1% cash back in due course. Again, this is nowhere near the 7.5% discount offered to the school, so please consider using our gift cards for some of your shopping.</h4><br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>How secure are the gift cards, and what can I do if I lose one?</h2>
        <h4>All cards should be looked after carefully and treated like cash.<br>If you do have a problem, please contact shopforchalloners@gmail.com or fill in a query form on this website for assistance. However, you should note that:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Tesco cards cannot be stopped.</li>
          <li>John Lewis gift cards can be stopped and the balance transferred to another card, as long as you have made a note of the 19 digit serial number on the back of the card. We recommend you do this upon receipt.</li>
          <li>Sainsbury's will block your old card and transfer the balance to a new card. Because the cards are top-up cards, we hold a central register of the serial numbers.</li>
        </ul>
        </h4><br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Have many cards gone missing in the past?</h2>
        <h4>The scheme has been running for over seventeen years (formerly as the <em>Supermarket Vouchers Scheme</em>). We are only aware of one incident of cards/vouchers being lost, and one of an adult's purse being stolen. In the latter case, we were able to stop their Sainsbury's card before someone tried to use it.</h4><br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>What do the cards look like?</h2>
        <h4>The Tesco cards are blue and red with the value printed on them.<br>The John Lewis/Waitrose cards are white and silver. They come in a cardboard wallet, on which we will write the amount on the card, and come with an envelope. They are suitable for use as presents.<br>The Sainsbury's cards are either green (everyday shopping cards) or orange and brown (dual shopping cards).</h4><br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>How do the Sainsbury's dual shopping cards work?</h2>
        <h4>Two cards are issued jointly, with the same serial number, so that two people in one family can have a card each, and access the same funds. Please request dual shopping cards when you notify us of your first order, or if you'd like to switch from the normal cards. The cards are topped up through a single monthly order.</h4><br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>How can I place an order?</h2>
        <h4>Simply fill in an online order form or email shopforchalloners@gmail.com with your requirements. Alternatively, you can print out a form from <em>documents and forms</em> tab and send it in to school. It should be posted in the "Shop for Challoner's" mail box, which is in the school dining room, on the wall to the left of the serving hatches, by the windows and side door.</h4><br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>When do I get my gift cards?</h2>
        <h4>The gift cards are available the week after the orders have been placed. See the <em>key dates</em> tab for precise dates.<br>An email is sent out each month to advise you that your gift cards are ready for collection.</h4><br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>How do I get my gift cards?</h2>
        <h4>They can be collected at school on the designated Thursday or Friday lunchtimes each month (12.30pm - 1.30pm) from the area between the hall and the dining room. When exams are in progress in the hall, they will be given out further down the corridor near to Matron's office.<br>Most staff and some parents collect their own orders, but many parents ask their daughters to collect their order for them. They will be asked to give their postcode for security purposes, and sign for the gift cards.<br>We can make alternative arrangements if you prefer. It is possible to collect your order from a member of the Shop for Challoner's team at a mutually convenient time, or, if you live in an area we are able to cover, it can be delivered to your house. For information about these options, fill in an online query form or email shopforchalloners@gmail.com.</h4><br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>How can I pay for the gift cards?</h2>
        <h4>The easiest way to pay is to set up a standing order. You will receive the same order every month, without having to think about it. The standing order form can be found in the <em>documents and forms</em> tab.<br>If you prefer, you can pay on a monthly basis, making a payment directly into the bank account, or by sending a cheque to school with your order form, to be posted in the "Shop for Challoner's" mail box.<br>If you wish to order in advance but require varying amounts from month to month, you can send in post-dated cheques for each month in the term, for example. Just use the order dates on the timetable.</h4><br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>How much of the discount goes to the school?</h2>
        <h4>The gift cards are available the week after the orders have been placed. See the <em>key dates</em> tab for precise dates.<br>An email is sent out each month to advise you that your gift cards are ready for collection.</h4><br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>What discount does each supermarket offer, and how much of this does the school receive?</h2>
        <h4>Tesco gives the school 5% of the value of the total orders. John Lewis gives 7.5%, while Sainsbury's offers 4%.<br>All of the funds we raise go to the school. The money is donated to the school via the Challoner's Girls Foundation, as it is a registered charity.</h4><br>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>Who runs the scheme?</h2>
        <h4>The scheme is administered entirely by parents who volunteer. If you think you can help, either now or in the future, please contact us by filling in a form on the <em>volunteer</em> page in the <em>contact</em> tab or by emailing us at shopforchalloners@gmail.com.</h4><br>
