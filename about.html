        <h1>How it works</h1>
        <p class="lead">The scheme is quite simple. On a monthly basis, we buy gift cards in bulk at a discount and sell them at face value. The school benefits from the full amount of the discount.</p>
      </div>

        <h2>What are the supermarkets offering?</h2>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h3>Tesco</h3>
          <p>Tesco supplies single use electronic gift cards which are available in &pound;100, &pound;50 and &pound;20 denominations.<br>Any change stays on the card.<br>They can be used in all Tesco stores and petrol stations, as well as online at Tesco Direct, Entertainment and Wine-by-the-case.<br>You can also use them at ESSO petrol stations with a Tesco Express shop.<br>You still get your Clubcard points.<br>Unfortunately groceries cannot be bought online with these gift cards.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h3>John Lewis and Waitrose</h3>
          <p>John Lewis supplies single use electronic gift cards.<br>You specify the amount you would like on the card.<br>Any change stays on the card.<br>They can be used in-store or online at johnlewis.com.<br>You can also use them in Waitrose stores or do your grocery shopping online at waitrose.com.<br>They make excellent wedding, Christmas, birthday and leaving presents.</p>
       </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h3>Sainsbury's</h3>
          <p>Sainsbury's offer an electronic gift card which is topped up remotely each month.<br>You specify the amount to be added each month.<br>Any change stays on the card.<br>It can only be used in-store.<br>You still get your Nectar points.<br>These cards are ideal for grandparents and relatives who do not live locally, or children away at university.<br>For those who prefer it, there is a dual shopping card, where two cards are issued jointly and both cards have access the same funds.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div>
        <h2>How much does the school receive?</h2>
        <h4>For every &pound;100 worth of vouchers ordered, Sainsbury's give the school &pound;4.00, Tesco &pound;5, and John Lewis/Waitrose a huge &pound;7.50!</h4><br>
      </div>

        <h2>What options do I have for ordering gift cards?</h2>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h3>Bank Transfer</h3>
          <p>If you wish, you can pay directly into the Shop for Challoner's account, whose details are:<br>"Vouchers"<br>Sort code: 20-02-06<br>Account no: 80092800<br>Ref: <em>your surname</em><br>With this method, you just need to let us know the details of what you would like.<br>To do this, either send an email to shopforchalloners@gmail.com containing the necessary information (which supermarkets, how many vouchers from each etc.) or fill in the details in the online form.</p>
          <p><a class="btn btn-danger" href="order.html" role="button">Fill in an online order form &raquo;</a></p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h3>Monthly Cheque</h3>
          <p>Alternatively, you can complete an order form (online or available for download) and attach a cheque (payable to "Vouchers") for the relevant amount.<br>Ask your daughter to post your order in the Shop for Challoner's mailbox in the school dining room, to the left of the serving hatches, near the windows and the side door.<br>The deadline for each monthly order is set out in the <em>key dates</em> tab.</p>
          <p><a class="btn btn-warning" href="dates.html" role="button">Key dates for this academic year &raquo;</a></p>
       </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4">
          <h3>Standing Order and Post-dated Cheque</h3>
          <p>If you would like to buy the same value every month, a standing order makes this really easy. Simply let us know what you would like, set up a standing order and your gift cards will be available for collection each month. Please note that <strong>this is not a direct debit</strong> - you remain in full control of your standing orders.<br>Alternatively, if the amount you wish to order varies from month to month, you can send in forms in advance with post-dated cheques.</p>
          <p><a class="btn btn-success" href="forms.html" role="button">Forms &raquo;</a></p>
        </div>
      </div>

        <h4>We want this to be a very flexible scheme, so please choose the option that suits you best. The downloadable order forms and standing order forms are available in the <em>documents and forms</em> tab.</h4><br>

      <div>
        <h2>How does collection of gift cards work?</h2>
        <p>Your gift cards will be available for collection by you or your daughter during the lunch hour (12.30pm - 1.30pm) on the designated Thursday and Friday of each month, in the area between the school hall and the dining room. If these times are missed, the gift cards will be available for collection from the Finance Office at the top of the stairs.<br>If you prefer, other arrangements can be made (including delivery for larger orders or collection from a member of the team in the evening), so please don't hesitate to contact us. Drop the team an email at shopforchalloners@gmail.com, or fill in an online query form.</p>
